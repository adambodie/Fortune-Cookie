Fortune Cookie
===================
## Technologies used
* Angular
* Typescript
* Webpack

### Version 1
I built this app first using AngularJS, to showcase my skills in AngularJS, as well as learning to build more projects other than the basic photo gallery. I later added CSS animation to this project to give a more interactive user experience.  I also added Grunt as a task runner to help build parts of the project, my first time using Grunt. 

### Version 2
With AngularJS being updated to Angular, I rebuilt this project using Angular with Typescript, backed with Webpack.
